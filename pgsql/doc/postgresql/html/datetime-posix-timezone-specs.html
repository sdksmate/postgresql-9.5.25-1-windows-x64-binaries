    One bug in this feature, which is unlikely to be fixed before it
    disappears, is that it fails to apply DST rules to dates after 2038.

   practice as of 2020 (that is, spring forward on the second Sunday of

><P
>   As an example, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3</TT

   current (as of 2020) timekeeping practice in Paris.  This specification
   says that standard time has the abbreviation <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CET</TT
> and
   is one hour ahead (east) of UTC; daylight savings time has the
   abbreviation <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CEST</TT

   of UTC; daylight savings time begins on the last Sunday in March at 2AM
   CET and ends on the last Sunday in October at 3AM CEST.

>EST5EDT</TT

   <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>CST6CDT</TT

CLASS="LITERAL"
>MST7MDT</TT

   and <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>PST8PDT</TT

   specifications.  However, they actually are treated as named time zones
   because (for historical reasons) there are files by those names in the
   IANA time zone database.  The practical implication of this is that
   these zone names will produce valid historical USA daylight-savings
   transitions, even when a plain POSIX specification would not due to
   lack of a suitable <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>posixrules</TT
> file.
  </P
><P
>   One should be wary that it is easy to misspell a POSIX-style time zone
   specification, since there is no check on the reasonableness of the
   zone abbreviation(s).  For example, <TT
CLASS="LITERAL"
>SET TIMEZONE TO
   FOOBAR0</TT
> will work, leaving the system effectively using a
   rather peculiar abbreviation for UTC.
