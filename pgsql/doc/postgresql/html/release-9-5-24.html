      additional connections, such as parallel processing or processing of
      multiple databases, the connection string was forgotten and just the
      basic connection parameters (database name, host, port, and
      username) were used for the additional connections.  This could lead
      to connection failures if the connection string included any other
      essential information, such as non-default SSL or GSS parameters.
      Worse, the connection might succeed but not be encrypted as
      intended, or be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks that the
      intended connection parameters would have prevented.
