     </P
><P
>      At the point where <TT
CLASS="COMMAND"
>CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY</TT
>
      waits for all concurrent transactions to complete so that it can see
      rows they inserted, it must also wait for all prepared transactions
      to complete, for the same reason.  Its failure to do so meant that
      rows inserted by prepared transactions might be omitted from the new
      index, causing queries relying on the index to miss such rows.
      In installations that have enabled prepared transactions
      (<TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>max_prepared_transactions</TT
> &gt; 0),
      it's recommended to reindex any concurrently-built indexes in
      case this problem occurred when they were built.

      creation of the new table, to handle importation of indexes and
      such.  It was possible for this re-examination to find a different
      table of the same name, causing unexpected behavior; one example is

      only the first segment was truncated immediately.  Other segments
      were simply unlinked, which doesn't authorize the kernel to release
      the storage so long as any other backends still have the files open.

      must be rounded off to a page boundary, and that was not done
      correctly.  No issue could arise unless an installation had gotten
      to within one page of SLRU overflow, which is unlikely in a
