>      Make contrib modules' installation scripts more secure (Tom Lane)
     </P
><P
>      Attacks similar to those described in CVE-2018-1058 could be carried
      out against an extension installation script, if the attacker can
      create objects in either the extension's target schema or the schema
      of some prerequisite extension.  Since extensions often require
      superuser privilege to install, this can open a path to obtaining
      superuser privilege.  To mitigate this risk, be more careful about
      the <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>search_path</TT
> used to run an installation
      script; disable <TT
CLASS="VARNAME"
>check_function_bodies</TT
> within the
      script; and fix catalog-adjustment queries used in some contrib
      modules to ensure they are secure.  Also provide documentation to
      help third-party extension authors make their installation scripts
      secure.  This is not a complete solution; extensions that depend on
      other extensions can still be at risk if installed carelessly.

      current transaction's snapshot, serialization conflict checking
      could draw the wrong conclusions about whether the tuple was relevant
      to the results of the current transaction.  This could allow a
      serializable transaction to commit when it should have failed with a
      serialization error.
